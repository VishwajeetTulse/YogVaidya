# Session Booking Date Fix - Complete Resolution

## Problem Summary
The issue was that both session bookings and mentor time slots were storing date fields as strings instead of proper DateTime objects, causing Prisma type conversion errors. This happened during both the booking process and the time slot lookup process.

## Root Cause Identified
**File**: `src/app/api/mentor/timeslots/[slotId]/book/route.ts`

The booking endpoint was using `prisma.$runCommandRaw()` with MongoDB's raw insert command. When using raw MongoDB operations, JavaScript Date objects get serialized to strings during the insertion process, bypassing Prisma's type handling.

### Problem Code (Before Fix):
```typescript
await prisma.$runCommandRaw({
  insert: 'sessionBooking',
  documents: [{
    _id: bookingId,
    // ... other fields
    scheduledAt: new Date(timeSlot.startTime), // Gets serialized to string
    createdAt: new Date(),                     // Gets serialized to string  
    updatedAt: new Date(),                     // Gets serialized to string
  }]
});
```

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Converted Raw MongoDB to Prisma Operations
**File**: `src/app/api/mentor/timeslots/[slotId]/book/route.ts`

#### Changes Made:
- **Session Booking Creation**: Replaced `$runCommandRaw` insert with `prisma.sessionBooking.create()`
- **Time Slot Lookup**: Replaced raw find with `prisma.mentorTimeSlot.findFirst()` with proper relations
- **Pending Bookings Count**: Replaced raw aggregation with `prisma.sessionBooking.count()`

#### Fixed Code (After):
```typescript
// Create booking with proper Prisma operation
const booking = await prisma.sessionBooking.create({
  data: {
    id: bookingId,
    userId: session.user.id,
    mentorId: timeSlot.mentorId,
    timeSlotId: resolvedParams.slotId,
    sessionType: timeSlot.sessionType,
    scheduledAt: new Date(timeSlot.startTime), // Properly handled as DateTime
    status: "SCHEDULED",
    notes: notes || "",
    paymentStatus: "PENDING",
    isDelayed: false
  }
});

// Fetch time slot with proper relations
const timeSlot = await prisma.mentorTimeSlot.findFirst({
  where: {
    id: resolvedParams.slotId,
    isActive: true
  },
  include: {
    mentor: {
      select: {
        id: true,
        name: true
      }
    }
  }
});

// Count pending bookings with Prisma
const pendingBookingsCount = await prisma.sessionBooking.count({
  where: {
    timeSlotId: resolvedParams.slotId,
    status: { in: ["SCHEDULED", "ONGOING"] },
    OR: [
      { paymentStatus: "COMPLETED" },
      { paymentStatus: "PENDING" }
    ]
  }
});
```

### 2. Database Cleanup
- Updated `fix-date-inconsistencies.js` script to include `mentorTimeSlot` collection
- Fixed existing string dates in all collections including time slots
- All historical bookings and time slots now have proper DateTime objects

## Verification Results

### Before Fix:
- ❌ New bookings created string dates instead of DateTime objects
- ❌ Prisma queries failed with type conversion errors
- ❌ Inconsistent date types across the database

### After Fix:
- ✅ New bookings create proper DateTime objects
- ✅ All Prisma queries work without type errors (including mentorTimeSlot lookups)
- ✅ Consistent date types across all collections including mentorTimeSlot
- ✅ Verified: Latest booking has proper Date objects for all date fields
- ✅ Verified: MentorTimeSlot queries work with proper Date objects

## Key Lessons

### 1. Avoid Raw MongoDB Commands for Data Creation
- Raw MongoDB operations bypass Prisma's type system
- JavaScript Date objects get serialized to strings in raw commands
- Use Prisma's ORM methods for consistent type handling

### 2. Use Proper Prisma Relations
- Include related data with `include` clause instead of raw queries
- Better type safety and intellisense
- Automatic relationship handling

### 3. Regular Auditing
- Implement periodic checks for data type consistency
- Use the provided `fix-date-inconsistencies.js` script for maintenance
- Monitor new date field additions for consistent typing

## Files Modified
1. `src/app/api/mentor/timeslots/[slotId]/book/route.ts` - **MAJOR** - Converted from raw MongoDB to Prisma operations
2. `scripts/fix-date-inconsistencies.js` - **USED** - Fixed existing inconsistent dates
3. `DATE_FIX_SUMMARY.md` - **UPDATED** - Added this comprehensive resolution

## Prevention Strategy
- ✅ All booking operations now use Prisma ORM
- ✅ Date utility functions available for manual operations
- ✅ Audit script available for ongoing maintenance
- ✅ Type-safe database operations throughout the application

## Status: ✅ RESOLVED
New session bookings will now create proper DateTime objects, and all existing date inconsistencies have been fixed. The application is now fully consistent with date type handling.
