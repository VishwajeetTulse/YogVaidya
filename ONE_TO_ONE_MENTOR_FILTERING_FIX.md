# 🎯 One-to-One Session Mentor Filtering Fix

## Problem
When users book one-to-one sessions with mentors from the "Explore Mentors" section and complete those sessions, those mentors were incorrectly appearing in the "My Mentors" section. This created confusion as users expected the "My Mentors" section to only show mentors they have ongoing relationships with.

## Root Cause
The `fetchMentorsFromPaidBookings` function in `user-mentor-server.ts` was treating ALL completed paid sessions as "assigned mentor relationships", regardless of whether they were:
- One-time one-to-one sessions (which should NOT create ongoing mentor relationships)
- Recurring sessions or group sessions (which SHOULD create ongoing mentor relationships)

## Solution
Modified the mentor filtering logic to only show mentors with "ongoing relationships" in the "My Mentors" section.

### A mentor is considered to have an "ongoing relationship" if they have:

✅ **Recurring sessions** - Indicates ongoing mentoring relationship  
✅ **Group sessions** (maxStudents > 1) - Group mentoring relationship  
✅ **Future scheduled sessions** - Upcoming appointments  
✅ **Multiple sessions with the user** - Pattern indicates ongoing relationship  

❌ **Single completed one-to-one sessions** - One-time consultation, not ongoing

## Technical Changes

### Modified `user-mentor-server.ts`:
1. **Enhanced MongoDB Aggregation Pipeline**: Added complex filtering logic to identify ongoing relationships
2. **Added Session Analysis**: Analyzes session patterns to determine relationship type
3. **Improved Logging**: Better debugging information for mentor filtering
4. **Added Documentation**: Clear comments explaining the filtering logic

### Key Database Fields Used:
- `maxStudents`: 1 = individual session, >1 = group session
- `isRecurring`: true = ongoing recurring sessions
- `scheduledAt`: future dates = upcoming sessions
- `status`: session completion status

## Test Results
Created comprehensive test scenarios to verify the logic:

| Scenario | Session Type | Should Show in "My Mentors" | Result |
|----------|--------------|----------------------------|---------|
| Single completed 1-to-1 | Individual, completed | ❌ NO | ✅ Correct |
| Recurring sessions | Recurring personal | ✅ YES | ✅ Correct |
| Group sessions | Group class | ✅ YES | ✅ Correct |
| Multiple 1-to-1 sessions | Multiple individual | ✅ YES | ✅ Correct |
| Future 1-to-1 session | Scheduled individual | ✅ YES | ✅ Correct |

## User Experience Impact

### Before Fix:
- ❌ User books one-time yoga session with mentor
- ❌ After session ends, mentor appears in "My Mentors"
- ❌ User confused - thinks they have ongoing mentor relationship
- ❌ "My Mentors" section cluttered with one-time mentors

### After Fix:
- ✅ User books one-time yoga session with mentor
- ✅ After session ends, mentor does NOT appear in "My Mentors"
- ✅ "My Mentors" only shows mentors with ongoing relationships
- ✅ Clean separation between one-time bookings and ongoing mentoring

## Files Modified
1. `src/lib/server/user-mentor-server.ts` - Core filtering logic
2. `test-mentor-filtering.js` - Test scenarios and validation

## Benefits
- 🎯 **Clear User Experience**: "My Mentors" only shows ongoing mentor relationships
- 🧹 **Reduced Confusion**: No more one-time mentors cluttering the mentor list
- 📈 **Better Organization**: Clear distinction between explore/book vs. ongoing mentoring
- 🔍 **Maintainable Code**: Well-documented logic with comprehensive test cases

---
**Status**: ✅ **FIXED** - One-to-one session mentors no longer appear in "My Mentors" after completion
