# 🎯 NEXT STEPS - Diet Plan Feature Setup

## ⚠️ Current Status

The diet plan feature is **fully implemented** but needs **environment configuration** before it can be tested.

---

## 🚨 IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED

### Problem Detected:
```
Error: Environment variable not found: DATABASE_URL
```

This means your `.env.local` file either:
1. Doesn't exist in the project root
2. Exists but doesn't have `DATABASE_URL` configured

---

## ✅ SOLUTION: Configure `.env.local`

### Step 1: Create/Update `.env.local` File

In your project root (`R:\Github\YogVaidya\`), create or update `.env.local`:

```env
# MongoDB Database Connection
DATABASE_URL="mongodb+srv://username:password@cluster.mongodb.net/dbname?retryWrites=true&w=majority"

# Email Service Configuration
SENDER_EMAIL="your-email@gmail.com"
SENDER_EMAIL_PASSWORD="your-app-specific-password"

# Application URL
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL="http://localhost:3000"

# Better Auth Configuration (if not already present)
BETTER_AUTH_SECRET="your-secret-key-here"
BETTER_AUTH_URL="http://localhost:3000"

# Google OAuth (if you're using it)
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID="your-google-client-id"
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET="your-google-client-secret"
```

### Step 2: Get Your MongoDB Connection String

**If you already have the database running:**
- Check your existing project documentation
- Ask your team lead for the connection string
- Or check your MongoDB Atlas dashboard

**Format should look like:**
```
mongodb+srv://yourUsername:yourPassword@cluster.mongodb.net/yogavaidyadb?retryWrites=true&w=majority
```

### Step 3: Push Database Changes

Once `.env.local` is configured:

```bash
cd R:\Github\YogVaidya
npx prisma db push
```

**Expected Success Output:**
```
Environment variables loaded from .env.local
Prisma schema loaded from prisma\schema.prisma
Datasource "db": MongoDB database "yogavaidyadb"

🚀  Your database is now in sync with your Prisma schema.
```

### Step 4: Start Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Server should start on `http://localhost:3000` without errors.

---

## 📋 Quick Verification Checklist

After completing the steps above:

- [ ] `.env.local` file exists in project root
- [ ] `DATABASE_URL` is configured in `.env.local`
- [ ] `npx prisma db push` completes successfully
- [ ] `npm run dev` starts without errors
- [ ] You can access `http://localhost:3000/dashboard`

---

## 🎯 What Happens Next

Once environment is configured, the system will automatically:

1. ✅ **Create `dietPlan` Collection** in MongoDB
2. ✅ **Add Required Indexes** for performance
3. ✅ **Enable Diet Plans Menu** in both dashboards
4. ✅ **Allow DIETPLANNER Mentors** to create plans
5. ✅ **Allow FLOURISH Students** to view plans

---

## 🧪 Testing After Setup

### Test 1: Mentor Access
```
1. Login as DIETPLANNER mentor
2. Navigate to Dashboard → Diet Plans
3. Should see: "Create Diet Plan" form
4. Dropdown should show FLOURISH subscribers
```

### Test 2: Create Diet Plan
```
1. Select a FLOURISH student
2. Enter title: "Test Plan"
3. Use rich text editor to add content
4. Click "Send to Student"
5. Check terminal for email notification log
```

### Test 3: Student Access
```
1. Login as FLOURISH student
2. Navigate to Dashboard → Diet Plans
3. Should see: List of diet plans
4. Click plan to view full content
```

## 💡 Don't Have Environment Variables?

### Option 1: Ask Your Team
- The database is likely already set up
- Team members should have the `.env.local` file
- Ask for a copy (with credentials)

### Option 2: Check Project Documentation
- Look for setup docs in the project
- Check Slack/Discord for shared credentials
- Review onboarding documentation

### Option 3: Set Up Fresh (If Starting New)
1. Create MongoDB Atlas account (free tier)
2. Create a new cluster
3. Get connection string
4. Update `.env.local`

---

## 🆘 Still Stuck?

### Common Issues:

**"I don't have the DATABASE_URL"**
→ Contact your team lead or check project documentation

**"I don't want to set up MongoDB yet"**
→ That's okay! The code is ready. You can test later when environment is configured.

**"How do I get SENDER_EMAIL_PASSWORD?"**
→ For Gmail: Enable 2FA → Generate App Password
→ For development: Can skip this, emails will log to console
