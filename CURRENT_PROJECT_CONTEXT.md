## ‚úÖ Recently Completed Fixes

### 1. **DateTime Handling** (Multiple files fixed)
- ‚úÖ Fixed MongoDB date conversion errors across the application
- ‚úÖ Session auto-completion working properly
- ‚úÖ Duration calculations accurate (actual vs planned)
- ‚úÖ Dashboard data loading without errors

### 2. **One-to-One Mentor Filtering** ‚úÖ
**File**: `src/lib/server/user-mentor-server.ts`  
**Issue**: One-time session mentors were appearing in "My Mentors" section  
**Solution**: Only show mentors with "ongoing relationships":
  - Has recurring sessions
  - Has group sessions (maxStudents > 1)
  - Has future scheduled sessions
  - Has multiple sessions with user

### 3. **One-to-One Session Navigation** ‚úÖ
**Files**: MentorTimeSlotBrowser, SessionCheckout components  
**Issue**: Back button redirected to `/mentors` instead of `/dashboard`  
**Solution**: Updated all navigation paths to return to user dashboard

### 4. **Session Duration Display** ‚úÖ
- Completed sessions show actual duration
- Ongoing sessions show real-time elapsed time
- Scheduled sessions show planned duration
- Proper fallback hierarchy implemented

## üéØ CURRENT FOCUS: Issues to Address

### A. **One-Time Session Issues**

#### 1. **Session Booking Flow**
**Current State**:
- ‚úÖ SessionCheckout component with 12-hour time picker
- ‚úÖ Payment integration via Razorpay working
- ‚úÖ SessionBooking model stores bookings correctly
- ‚úÖ API endpoints functioning (`/api/mentor/book-session`, `/api/mentor/verify-session-payment`)

**Potential Issues to Check**:
- [ ] Are one-time sessions appearing correctly in student dashboard?
- [ ] Are one-time sessions visible in mentor's "My Sessions" section?
- [ ] Is the status update flow working (SCHEDULED ‚Üí ONGOING ‚Üí COMPLETED)?
- [ ] Are completed one-time sessions being excluded from "My Mentors" (should be ‚úÖ fixed)

#### 2. **Session Display & Visibility**
**Files to Review**:
- `src/components/dashboard/user/sections/classes-section.tsx` (student view)
- `src/components/dashboard/mentor/sections/sessions-section.tsx` (mentor view)
- `src/lib/server/user-sessions-server.ts` (fetches user sessions)
- `src/lib/server/mentor-sessions-server.ts` (fetches mentor sessions)

**What to Verify**:
- [ ] One-time sessions (SessionBooking) merged with subscription sessions (Schedule)
- [ ] Correct filtering by status (SCHEDULED, ONGOING, COMPLETED)
- [ ] Proper session categorization (individual vs subscription)
- [ ] Action buttons showing correctly (Start Session, Join, etc.)

---

### B. **Dashboard Overview Issues**

#### 1. **User Dashboard Overview**
**File**: `src/components/dashboard/user/sections/overview-section.tsx`  
**Current Features**:
- Welcome message with personalized greeting
- Trial status banner (if on trial)
- No access banner (if subscription expired)
- Today's schedule section
- Upcoming sessions section
- Quick action cards

**Potential Issues**:
- [ ] Are one-time booked sessions appearing in "Today's Schedule"?
- [ ] Are session counts accurate (classes this week)?
- [ ] Is practice time calculation correct?
- [ ] Are streak days calculating properly?
- [ ] Are upcoming sessions from both subscription AND one-time bookings showing?

**Data Source**: `src/lib/actions/dashboard-data.ts`
```typescript
// Returns: classesThisWeek, totalPracticeTime, goalsAchieved, 
// streakDays, todaySchedule, upcomingSessions, monthlyStats
```

#### 2. **Mentor Dashboard Overview**
**File**: `src/components/dashboard/mentor/sections/overview-section.tsx`  
**Current Features**:
- Active students count
- Sessions this week count
- Average rating
- Today's sessions list
- Upcoming sessions list
- Recent activity feed
- Monthly stats

**Potential Issues**:
- [ ] Are one-time individual bookings appearing in today's sessions?
- [ ] Are both subscription and one-time sessions merged correctly?
- [ ] Is the session count accurate?
- [ ] Are earnings calculations including one-time session payments?
- [ ] Are session action buttons working (Start Session)?

**Data Source**: `src/lib/server/mentor-overview-server.ts`

## üîç Files to Investigate

### Critical Files for One-Time Sessions:
1. **User Side**:
   - `src/lib/server/user-sessions-server.ts` - Fetches all user sessions
   - `src/components/dashboard/user/sections/classes-section.tsx` - Displays sessions
   - `src/lib/actions/dashboard-data.ts` - Dashboard overview data

2. **Mentor Side**:
   - `src/lib/server/mentor-sessions-server.ts` - Fetches mentor sessions
   - `src/components/dashboard/mentor/sections/sessions-section.tsx` - Displays bookings
   - `src/lib/server/mentor-overview-server.ts` - Overview dashboard data

3. **Session Management**:
   - `src/lib/services/session-service.ts` - Session completion logic
   - `src/lib/services/session-status-service.ts` - Auto status updates
   - `src/app/api/admin/update-session-status/route.ts` - Status update endpoint
