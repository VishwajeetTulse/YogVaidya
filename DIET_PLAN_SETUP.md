# Diet Plan Feature - Setup Instructions

## üö® Important: Environment Configuration Required

Before the diet plan feature can work, you need to ensure your environment variables are properly configured.

---

## Step 1: Configure Environment Variables

Create or update your `.env.local` file in the project root with the following variables:

```env
# Database
DATABASE_URL="your-mongodb-connection-string"

# Email Service
SENDER_EMAIL="your-email@gmail.com"
SENDER_EMAIL_PASSWORD="your-app-password"

# App URL (for email links)
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL="http://localhost:3000"  # or your production URL
```

### Getting Your MongoDB Connection String:

If you're using MongoDB Atlas:
1. Go to your MongoDB Atlas dashboard
2. Click "Connect" on your cluster
3. Choose "Connect your application"
4. Copy the connection string
5. Replace `<password>` with your actual password
6. Format: `mongodb+srv://username:password@cluster.mongodb.net/dbname?retryWrites=true&w=majority`

---

## Step 2: Push Database Changes

Once `.env.local` is configured with `DATABASE_URL`, run:

```bash
npx prisma db push
```

This will:
- ‚úÖ Create the `dietPlan` collection in MongoDB
- ‚úÖ Add necessary indexes
- ‚úÖ Update relations

**Expected Output:**
```
‚úî Your database is now in sync with your Prisma schema
```

---

## Step 3: Verify Prisma Client

Ensure Prisma client is generated with the new model:

```bash
npx prisma generate
```

**Expected Output:**
```
‚úî Generated Prisma Client
```

---

## Step 4: Start Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

The server should start without errors on `http://localhost:3000`

# Run MailDev
maildev

# View emails at: http://localhost:1080
```

For production (using Gmail):
1. Enable 2-factor authentication on your Gmail
2. Generate an App Password:
   - Go to Google Account ‚Üí Security
   - App Passwords
   - Generate new password
3. Add to `.env.local`:
   ```
   SENDER_EMAIL="your-email@gmail.com"
   SENDER_EMAIL_PASSWORD="generated-app-password"
   ```
