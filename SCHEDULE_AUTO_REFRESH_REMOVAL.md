# Schedule Section Auto-Refresh Removal & Manual Refresh Addition

## Overview
Removed automatic refresh functionality from the mentor dashboard schedule section and added a manual refresh button for better user control and performance.

## Changes Made

### 1. **Removed Auto-Refresh Mechanism**
**File:** `src/components/dashboard/mentor/sections/schedule-section.tsx`

**What was removed:**
```tsx
// Set up auto-refresh every 30 seconds for real-time updates
const interval = setInterval(() => {
  console.log('ðŸ”„ Auto-refreshing mentor data...');
  loadTimeSlots();
}, 30000);

return () => clearInterval(interval);
```

**Benefits:**
- Improved performance by eliminating unnecessary API calls
- Reduced server load from constant polling
- Better user experience (no interruption while editing)
- Prevents potential race conditions during form submissions

### 2. **Added Manual Refresh Button**
**Location:** Top-right of "Your Available Time Slots" section header

**Features:**
- **Responsive Design:** 
  - Desktop: Shows "Refresh" text with icon
  - Mobile: Shows only refresh icon to save space
- **Visual Feedback:**
  - Spinning animation while refreshing
  - "Refreshing..." text during operation
  - Disabled state during refresh to prevent multiple calls
- **User Feedback:**
  - Success toast message on successful refresh
  - Error toast message if refresh fails

**Implementation:**
```tsx
// State management
const [refreshing, setRefreshing] = useState(false);

// Manual refresh function
const handleManualRefresh = async () => {
  setRefreshing(true);
  try {
    await loadTimeSlots();
    toast.success('Time slots refreshed successfully');
  } catch (error) {
    toast.error('Failed to refresh time slots');
  } finally {
    setRefreshing(false);
  }
};

// Responsive button component
<Button
  variant="outline"
  size="sm"
  onClick={handleManualRefresh}
  disabled={refreshing}
  className="h-8 px-2 sm:px-3"
>
  <RefreshCw className={`h-4 w-4 ${refreshing ? 'animate-spin' : ''}`} />
  <span className="hidden sm:inline ml-1">
    {refreshing ? 'Refreshing...' : 'Refresh'}
  </span>
</Button>
```

### 3. **Preserved Existing Refresh Triggers**
The following automatic refresh triggers remain intact (appropriate behavior):
- After creating new time slots
- After editing time slots
- After deleting time slots
- Initial page load

## User Experience Impact

### **Before:**
- Time slots refreshed automatically every 30 seconds
- Users had no control over refresh timing
- Potential interruption during form filling
- Unnecessary API calls even when not needed

### **After:**
- Users control when to refresh data
- Better performance with on-demand updates
- Clear visual feedback during refresh
- Responsive design adapts to screen size
- Professional UX with proper loading states

## Technical Benefits

1. **Performance:** Reduced API calls from constant polling
2. **User Control:** Manual refresh gives users control over when data updates
3. **Battery Life:** Less CPU usage on mobile devices
4. **Server Load:** Reduced unnecessary requests to the server
5. **UX:** No interruption during form interactions

## Responsive Design Details

### Button Behavior:
- **Desktop (â‰¥640px):** Full button with "Refresh" text + icon
- **Mobile (<640px):** Icon-only button to save horizontal space

### Visual States:
- **Normal:** Outlined button with refresh icon
- **Loading:** Spinning refresh icon with "Refreshing..." text
- **Disabled:** Grayed out during refresh operation

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Functionality:**
   - Click refresh button and verify time slots update
   - Verify success/error toast messages
   - Test disabled state during refresh

2. **Responsive Design:**
   - Test on mobile devices (icon-only button)
   - Test on tablet/desktop (full button with text)
   - Verify button fits properly in header

3. **Performance:**
   - Confirm no automatic refreshing occurs
   - Verify refresh only happens on manual trigger
   - Check for proper cleanup of event listeners

## File Modified
- `src/components/dashboard/mentor/sections/schedule-section.tsx`

## Status: âœ… COMPLETE
Auto-refresh mechanism removed and replaced with user-controlled manual refresh button with responsive design.
