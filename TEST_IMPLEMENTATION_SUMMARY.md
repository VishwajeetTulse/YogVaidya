#### 3. **NPM Scripts Added**
```json
"test": "vitest --run"                    // Run tests once
"test:watch": "vitest"                    // Watch mode
"test:ui": "vitest --ui"                  // Visual dashboard
"test:coverage": "vitest --run --coverage" // Coverage report
```

#### 4. **Test Suites Created (79 Tests)**

**a) Razorpay Payment Gateway Tests** (11 tests)
- `src/lib/services/__tests__/razorpay-service.test.ts`
- Focus: Payment security, validation, error handling
- Covers: Email validation, amount conversion, API error handling

**b) Session Service Tests** (10 tests)
- `src/lib/services/__tests__/session-service.test.ts`
- Focus: Session data integrity, ID validation, status transitions
- Covers: MongoDB ObjectId format, time range validation, collection handling

**c) Utility Functions Tests** (28 tests)
- `src/lib/utils/__tests__/validation-utilities.test.ts`

- Covers: 13 major utility categories with edge cases

**d) API Routes Tests** (30 tests)
- `src/app/api/__tests__/api-routes.test.ts`

- Covers: HTTP status codes, payment validation, session patterns, rate limiting

#### 5. **Coverage Reporting**
```
Total Tests: 79 ✅ PASSING
Coverage: 39.2% statements | 61.53% branches | 50% functions | 39.2% lines
Thresholds: 35% statements | 35% branches | 45% functions | 35% lines
Status: ✅ PASSING
```

Coverage report generates HTML at `coverage/index.html` with line-by-line details.

#### 6. **CI/CD Integration**
- `.github/workflows/test-and-build.yml` created
- Runs on: All pushes to main/develop, all PRs
- Tests matrix: Node 18.x and 20.x
- Steps:
  1. Install dependencies
  2. Run lint (strict mode)
  3. Check formatting
  4. Run tests
  5. Generate coverage
  6. Upload to Codecov
  7. Build Next.js application
  8. Verify build output

#### 7. **Documentation**
- `TESTING.md` created with comprehensive guide covering:
  - Test framework overview
  - All 79 tests documented
  - Current coverage report
  - How to run tests
  - How to write new tests
  - Testing patterns for APIs, components, services
  - Mocking strategies for external APIs
  - Next steps and improvement plan
  - Troubleshooting guide
